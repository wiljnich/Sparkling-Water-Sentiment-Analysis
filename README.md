 An analysis of sparkling water brand popularity on Twitter using Tweepy. This code was heavily adapted from code developed by [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/). A visualization with costs can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/william.nicholas#!/vizhome/SparklingWaterSentimentAnalysis/Sentimentvs_CostDashboard) and a writeup can be found on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@wiljnich/the-battle-of-the-bubbles-which-sparkling-water-should-be-your-vanity-post-this-summer-16e02412e1ca?source=friends_link&sk=41fa2547049ae78101cf53d20a07d25f).
