# Sparkling Water Sentiment Analysis
 An analysis of sparkling water brand popularity on Twitter using Tweepy. This code was heavily adapted from code developed by [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/). A visualization with costs can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/william.nicholas#!/vizhome/SparklingWaterSentimentAnalysis/Sentimentvs_CostDashboard) and a writeup can be found on my [Medium](https://www.medium.com/@wiljnich).
